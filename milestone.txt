🗺️ Project Roadmap: Real-Time NBA Game Insight Pipeline
Phase 1: Project Setup & Simulation (Week 1–2)
🎯 Goal: Simulate live data and design your base system.

✅ Milestones:
Set up a GitHub repo, README, and dev environment

Choose historical NBA data (e.g., 2023–24 season)

Build a data simulator to "stream" play-by-play events line-by-line

Set up Kafka (or Redis as a simpler first step) for ingestion

🛠️ Tools:
NBA data: stats.nba.com, basketball-reference.com

Streaming simulator: Python script with time.sleep()

Kafka: Docker + confluent-kafka (Python), or Redis Pub/Sub

Phase 2: Stream Processing & Feature Engineering (Week 3–4)
🎯 Goal: Ingest and process data in real time.

✅ Milestones:
Consume events using Kafka or Redis

Extract game state features: score diff, possession, game clock, last 5 plays

Build rolling features with sliding windows (e.g., moving averages)

Set up Apache Spark Streaming or Faust (Python)

🛠️ Tools:
Faust (Python stream processing library)

Spark Structured Streaming + PySpark

Pandas, NumPy

Phase 3: Model Training (Week 5–6)
🎯 Goal: Train a model to predict game outcome or key event.

✅ Milestones:
Build labeled dataset (win/loss or scoring run)

Train baseline model (logistic regression, XGBoost)

Evaluate accuracy and calibration (e.g., Brier score, AUC)

Save model using joblib or torch.save

🛠️ Tools:
Scikit-learn or XGBoost for tabular data

Optionally PyTorch if using sequence models

Jupyter or Colab notebooks

Phase 4: Inference API (Week 7)
🎯 Goal: Serve your model via a real-time API.

✅ Milestones:
Build FastAPI app with a /predict endpoint

Load and serve the trained model

Accept streaming game state JSON and return prediction

🛠️ Tools:
FastAPI, Uvicorn

Docker for containerization

Phase 5: Real-Time Dashboard (Week 8)
🎯 Goal: Visualize predictions and game data live.

✅ Milestones:
Create a dashboard with Streamlit or Flask + JS

Show current game state + win probability updates

Add player-specific stats or fatigue metrics

🛠️ Tools:
Streamlit (easy, reactive Python UI)

Altair or Plotly for charts

Phase 6: Logging & Monitoring (Optional Stretch)
🎯 Goal: Make the pipeline observable and production-friendly.

✅ Milestones:
Add logging (e.g., game ID, predictions, latencies)

Track model performance and drift over time

Monitor pipeline health with Prometheus + Grafana

🛠️ Tools:
Prometheus, Grafana

MLflow (for model versioning)
